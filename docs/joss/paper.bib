    abstract = {The context-free language (CFL) reachability problem is a well-known fundamental formulation in program analysis. In practice, many program analyses, especially pointer analyses, adopt a restricted version of CFL-reachability, Dyck-CFL-reachability, and compute on edge-labeled bidirected graphs. Solving the all-pairs Dyck-CFL-reachability on such bidirected graphs is expensive. For a bidirected graph with n nodes and m edges, the traditional dynamic programming style algorithm exhibits a subcubic time complexity for the Dyck language with k kinds of parentheses. When the underlying graphs are restricted to bidirected trees, an algorithm with O(n log n log k) time complexity was proposed recently. This paper studies the Dyck-CFL-reachability problems on bidirected trees and graphs. In particular, it presents two fast algorithms with O(n) and O(n + m log m) time complexities on trees and graphs respectively. We have implemented and evaluated our algorithms on a state-of-the-art alias analysis for Java. Results on standard benchmarks show that our algorithms achieve orders of magnitude speedup and consume less memory.},

    abstract = {General sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) is a fundamental building block for numerous applications such as algebraic multigrid method (AMG), breadth first search and shortest path problem. Compared to other sparse BLAS routines, an efficient parallel SpGEMM implementation has to handle extra irregularity from three aspects: (1) the number of nonzero entries in the resulting sparse matrix is unknown in advance, (2) very expensive parallel insert operations at random positions in the resulting sparse matrix dominate the execution time, and (3) load balancing must account for sparse data in both input matrices.In this work we propose a framework for SpGEMM on GPUs and emerging CPU-GPU heterogeneous processors. This framework particularly focuses on the above three problems. Memory pre-allocation for the resulting matrix is organized by a hybrid method that saves a large amount of global memory space and efficiently utilizes the very limited on-chip scratchpad memory. Parallel insert operations of the nonzero entries are implemented through the GPU merge path algorithm that is experimentally found to be the fastest GPU merge approach. Load balancing builds on the number of necessary arithmetic operations on the nonzero entries and is guaranteed in all stages.Compared with the state-of-the-art CPU and GPU SpGEMM methods, our approach delivers excellent absolute performance and relative speedups on various benchmarks multiplying matrices with diverse sparsity structures. Furthermore, on heterogeneous processors, our SpGEMM approach achieves higher throughput by using re-allocatable shared virtual memory. We design a framework for SpGEMM on modern manycore processors using the CSR format.We present a hybrid method for pre-allocating the resulting sparse matrix.We propose an efficient parallel insert method for long rows of the resulting matrix.We develop a heuristic-based load balancing strategy.Our approach significantly outperforms other known CPU and GPU SpGEMM methods.},

    abstract = {Sparse linear algebra is a cornerstone of modern computational science. These algorithms ignore the zero-valued entries found in many domains in order to work on much larger problems at much faster rates than dense algorithms. Nonetheless, optimizing these algorithms is not straightforward. Highly optimized algorithms for multiplying a sparse matrix by a dense vector, for instance, are the subject of a vast corpus of research and can be hundreds of times longer than na\"{\i}ve implementations. Optimized sparse linear algebra libraries are thus needed so that users can build applications without enormous effort.Hardware vendors release proprietary libraries that are highly optimized for their devices, but they limit interoperability and promote vendor lock-in. Open libraries often work across multiple devices and can quickly take advantage of new innovations, but they may not reach peak performance. The goal of this work is to provide a sparse linear algebra library that offers both of these advantages.We thus describe clSPARSE, a permissively licensed open-source sparse linear algebra library that offers state-of-the-art optimized algorithms implemented in OpenCL™. We test clSPARSE on GPUs from AMD and Nvidia and show performance benefits over both the proprietary cuSPARSE library and the open-source ViennaCL library.},
